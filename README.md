# HTTP IN-CLASS LECTURE

# Introduce: HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

Consider a scenario where someone wants to request a document from someone. What is the protocol for that, assuming the request and response both utilize snail mail (i.e., the postal service). 

With a partner, write down the steps that the SENDER needs to perform to create and send their request. 
    Sender Actions:
  * Write down addresses (to/from) on the top of the letter and the envelope.
  * Write down the request ("GET")
  * Stamp
  * Send it 

With a partner, write down the steps that the RECEIVER needs to perform to react to the request and send a response. 

 ```java
/** HTTP Client. */
private static HttpClient HTTP_CLIENT = Http.Client.newBuilder()
.version(HttpClient.Version.HTTP_2)            // uses HTTP protocol version 2 where possible
.followRedirects(HttpClient.Redirect.NORMAL)   // always redirects, except from HTTPS to HTTP
.build();
 ```

```java
public static void main (String[] args) {

URI resource = URI.create("http://computing.uga.edu");
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
.uri(resource)
.build();

String s = "aaaa" + "bbbb"; // "+" operator connect the statement together in different lines
try {

    BodyHandler<String> bodyHandler = BodyHandlers.ofString();
    HttpResponse<String> response = HTTP_CLIENT.<String>send(request, bodyHandler);
    int code = response.statusCode();
    if (code != 200) {
        throw new IOException("HTTP" + code);
    } //if
    String body = response.body();
    System.out.println(code); //200  means OK
    System.out.println(body);
} catch (IOExceptionInterruptedException cause) {
        System.err.println(cause);
        cause.printStackTrace();

    } //try
} //main
```

If the code compiles and runs, the result should be "200" but if it's "404", that means it's not OK.
